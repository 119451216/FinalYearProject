## About
This project is my submission for my Final Year Project for the course CK203 Bsc Business Information Systems. The assignment was to identify a problem in an existing 
company, devlop a solution to solve the problem, and demonstrate it working. The problem I identified was the efficiency of a company's resource management, and this project
is the solution I have developed to fix the problem.

## Getting Started
To access the project, follow the following steps:

ZIP:
- Extract the project to your computer.
- Open the solution file in the folder using Visual Studio.
- Execute the project.

In order to run the project correctly, I have attached my SQL Server database in a seperate folder in my submission file. If you intend to run this project for other reasons you will
require your own SQL Server database access the application.

## Installing
The following pieces of software are required to run this project correctly:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

## Usage
The goal of this project was to help manage a company's resouces. I attempted to do this my developing a resource management tool that can be implemented to the company's
internal systems. There are several features to this application:

- Login system.
- Application-wide authentication system.
- Ability to view and create projects.
- Ability to view details of company's employees.
- Availability page to request leave from work.
- Ability to add requests for leave from work.

Some features of the application are only available for user's with the suitable authentication level. These features are as follows:

- View details of projects.
- View details of employees.
- Approve requests from employees.
- Manage the workload of resouces.
- Can create projects.
- Can edit and update employee information.
